In test mode, RazorpayX Postpaid allows you to simulate the usage of the postpaid feature without real financial transactions. Here's what you need to know about payments and testing in this environment:

Test Mode Overview:
Simulation: In test mode, transactions are simulated, meaning no real money is exchanged. It's used for development and testing purposes to ensure that the integration works correctly before going live.
No Real Charges: You will not be charged for transactions made in test mode. The transactions are virtual and used solely for testing the functionality of your integration.
What Happens in Test Mode:
Testing Integration: You can test the integration of RazorpayX Postpaid in your application, check the user experience, and ensure that everything functions as expected.
No Real Payment: Since the transactions are simulated, you do not need to pay Razorpay for the test transactions. Razorpay does not collect any actual payment or process real financial transactions in test mode.
When You Go Live:
Live Transactions: When you switch to live mode and start processing real transactions with RazorpayX Postpaid, actual payments and repayments will be involved.
Billing: For live transactions, you will need to pay Razorpay according to their pricing model and transaction fees. Razorpay will handle real payments and charge you accordingly based on the services used.
To Summarize:
In Test Mode: You are not required to pay Razorpay for transactions made while testing.
In Live Mode: You will need to adhere to Razorpay’s billing and transaction fees for actual transactions.
If you have further questions about Razorpay’s billing or need clarification on test mode vs. live mode, contacting Razorpay support can provide specific guidance.
